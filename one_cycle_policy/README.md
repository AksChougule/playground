## CIFAR with Cyclic LR and One Cycle

Source: Github repo by Nachiket272

This module uses CIFAR-10 dataset and resnet56 model and try to recreate results from following 2 papers:
1) Learning Rate Finder (Cyclic learning rates) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186)
2) One Cycle Policy ( Using Cyclic momentum with cyclic learning rates) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820)

A quick explanation of the theory can be found in [this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/finding-good-learning-rate-and-the-one-cycle-policy-7159fe1db5d6).
